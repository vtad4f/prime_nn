# Description
The goal of this project will be to use neural networks for prime number detection and/or factorization.
None of this matters once using quantum computers for decryption is commonplace. For now though,
whatever we come up with will need to run faster than the ECM, QS, or GNFS algorithms for large numbers
in order to be useful. That being said, in the early stages of the project the majority of time will be spent
focusing on the smaller primes (for the sake of faster run times). In any case, datasets of prime numbers
are readily available, which should make testing and training easier. It will probably be best to start by
reading the 'Shultz' article(s) described in the stackexchange page (below). We may want to repeat some of
the work they describe, but ideally we would try to find a different path forward.
